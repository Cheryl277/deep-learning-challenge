Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The model 'target variable' is going to be 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', which determines if the money was used effectively by the organization 

- What variable(s) are the features for your model?
The features are going to various features such as:
'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INCOME_AMT', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS', and 'ASK_AMT

-What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Variables such as 'APPLICATION_TYPE' and 'CLASSIFICATION" can be dropped as they are neither features 
nor targets that we needed to complete the analysis.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

-How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
For this neural network I chose to have two hidden layers (layer 1 & 2), with 2,381 nodes,
with activation function ReLU.

-Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No, I wasn't able to achieve the target model performance with the accuracy of 71.51%
